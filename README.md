A project using Python and OpenCV, which emulates the cloaking effect popularized in movies. The code captures a static background image, detects a specific color (like blue) using HSV color space, and then replaces the detected color in the video stream with the previously captured background, creating the illusion of invisibility. This project involved real-time video processing, background subtraction, and color masking techniques, showcasing my skills in computer vision and Python programming.
